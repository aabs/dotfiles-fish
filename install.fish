# What this script does
# =====================
#
# The purpose of this script is to download and install the latest stable fishdots release.
# In the process it will do the following:

# 1. Create a download area, into which the release will be decompressed.

# 2. Establish a dotfiles management area called `$HOME/.config/fishdots/gens` 
#    where all scripts and plugins will be stored

# 3. Replace all pre-existing scripts with indirect symlinks that 
#    point to the original files stored in `$HOME/.config/fishdots/gens/original`.

# 4. Establish a first generation `$HOME/.config/fishdots/gens/gen1` that holds
#    links to the scripts established by default by fishdots.
